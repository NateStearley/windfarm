#### Wind Turbine Power Generation

The power output ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\(P\)) of a wind turbine can be calculated using the formula:

\[ P = \frac{1}{2} \rho A v^3 C_P \]

where:
- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\(\rho\)) is the air density (kg/m^3), which can be calculated from air pressure and temperature.
- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\(A\)) is the swept area of the turbine blades (m^2).
- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\(v\)) is the wind speed at the height of the turbine hub (m/s).
- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\(C_P\)) is the power coefficient, which depends on the turbine design and the operational conditions.
